An interpreter for the Datalog language.

## What is this?

> Datalog is a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) language. While it is syntactically a subset of [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), Datalog generally uses a bottom-up rather than top-down evaluation model. This difference yields significantly different behavior and properties from [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). It is often used as a query language for deductive databases. Datalog has been applied to problems in data integration, networking, program analysis, and more.
